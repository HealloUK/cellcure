After contacting the Medical Advisor via the patient form or live chat, information about the condition is requested and transmitted to the doctor. Our doctors will carefully review the patient's medical history and current health indicators. At this stage, if the doctor thinks that the patient is not medically suitable for this treatment or that cell therapy's chance of working is too low, he decides not to treat. It's important to realize that stem cells do not provide a cure for every disease.

If the patient is approved for Cell Therapy, the patient and the medical adviser determine the application date together. He/She purchases the airline ticket and confirms his appointment by providing the medical advisor with his information.

A private vehicle will pick up the patient at the airport when he/she lands in Istanbul and transports him/her to the hotel where he/she will be staying.



## **Before the procedure of Stem Cell treatment**

A private vehicle transports the patient to the clinic. If necessary, some tests can be done. Considering the status of the patient, the doctor decides which cell product to be used, source of the cells and the route of its administration.

A biopsy sample is harvested from the tissue suitable for the patient's condition under local anesthesia. If it is not possible to use the patient's own tissue due to reasons such as contraindications to anesthesia, the risk of bleeding, severe conditions, donor(allogeneic) cell products are recommended.

It could take up to 4-6 weeks for the stem cells to be ready for transplantation. In this process, the patient does not have to be in the clinic.

A few days before the start of cell therapy, a general blood test and a general urine test are administered to the patient. Specialist examines the patient to ensure there are no contraindications.


## **Stem Cell Transplantation Phase**

This phase takes 1-2 hours at most.

Depending on the underlying disease, the cell product is administered in the one of following routes;
* intravenous
* intramuscular
* intrathecal
* intradermal
* directly into the affected area

ECG monitoring will be used by the doctor to check on the patient's heart both during and after the procedure. Heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation level, and urine are also monitored.
If all is well, the patient immediately returns to his normal life after the transplantation.

According to the type of disease, Cell Therapy can be combined with other treatment methods to increase the regenerative effect of Stem Cell and reduce symptoms.

## **How soon will I see improvement?**

Transplanted cells typically take a few weeks or months to begin to fully take impact, although the first improvements can be noticeable right away after administration.
