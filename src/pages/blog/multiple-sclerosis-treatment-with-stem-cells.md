Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS). The patient's immune system attacks nerve cells, causing damage to the myelin sheath that covers them. If the myelin sheath is damaged(demyelination), the nerve cell no longer effectively transmits signals.

Current treatments targeting inflammation help patients manage their symptoms and try to avoid harm to the nerve cells. But they do not help repair damage once it has occurred.

Increasing evidence regarding the inflammatory-reducing and immunomodulatory properties of stem cells makes them a very important candidate for the treatment of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). [Studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7698327/#:~:text=6.-,Clinical%20Trials,-Using%20MSCs) have shown that stem cells have the potential to slow/stop the progression of the disease for a long time and improve impaired functions.

Results can be expected after the Multiple Sclerosis Treatment with Stem Cells;
* Improvements in Motor Function, Sensitivity, Balance, Coordination
* Increase in energy, muscle strength
* Reduction in fatigue
* Overall improvement in quality of life

The effectiveness of the therapy might differ from one patient to another due to many factors, such as the patientâ€™s medical course, physical condition, severity, age and so on.


## **Some Properties of Stem Cells**

* MSCs have immunomodulatory properties that may benefit the treatment of MS.
* MSCs can limit neuronal damage in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) by secreting a wide range of neuroprotective factors.
* MSCs influence remyelination directly or indirectly with many chemicals they secrete in the inflammation area.
