Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) refer to a group of complex neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by social impairments, communication difficulties, and restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped patterns of behavior. ASD begins in early childhood and lasts throughout a person's life.

ASD is believed to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. But the exact reason is not known yet. According to a [later study](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2018.00405/full), Autism and autoimmune disorder have been linked. In a [study](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1906817116) conducted by Tufts University on children with autism, high amounts of inflammation-triggering molecules found in the brain region of children with autism responsible for memory and attention. Another [report](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7794774/) claims that the inflammation brought on by gut dysbiosis, which results in neurotoxic loading into the brain, is the likely cause of autism.

There is no standard cure for autism. Numerous strategies exist to reduce the symptoms of autistic people and increase their potential such as Cognitive behavior therapy, Early intervention, Speech-language therapy, Social skills training etc. In addition, many children with autism use psychoactive drugs or anticonvulsants. While these drugs only reduce certain symptoms, their side effects can be problematic for children.

Due to their capacity to modulate the immune system and reduce inflammation, stem cells are a promising therapeutic option for Autism. They have the potential to restore damaged cells and tissues. Micro substances called exosomes, produced from stem cells can reach the damaged area by crossing the blood-brain barrier.  
They can promote the renewal and restoration of neurons in the area by secreting cytokines and survival-promoting growth factors.


## **How could mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) help?**

Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder in which the areas of the brain responsible for attention, memory, concentration, emotions and speech are affected. The primary goal of treatment is to restore and protect the brain's functional neurologic circuitry.

With their numerous therapeutic properties, exosomes and stem cells can contribute directly or indirectly to the treatment of autism.

Some of the potential [features](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcell.2022.809686/full#:~:text=2.7.1%20Potential-,Mechanism,-of%20MSCs%20in) of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs);
* Cytokines, chemokines and growth factors secreted by stem cells stimulate the repair and restoration of injured tissues. (Paracrine Effect)
* Promoting new blood vessel formation (Angiogenesis).
* Promoting the formation of synapses between neurons in the nervous system. (Synaptogenesis)
* Providing bioactive substances to restore or regenerate functioning brain circuits.
* Providing neuroprotection by using anti-inflammatory mechanisms.
* Potential to calm autoimmune reactions and heal the gut.

## **Safety of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs)**

The effects of MSCs extracted from the bone marrow (BM-MSC), umbilical cord (UC-MSC), and adipose tissue (AT-MSC) have been investigated in several clinical trials involving thousands of people and a wide range of human diseases. Many reviews and [meta-analyses](https://stemcellpoint.com/safety-of-stem-cell-therapy) examining the results of these clinical studies concluded that stem cell therapy had no serious side effects.

## **What to expect from treatment?**

The safety and efficacy of stem cell therapy for autism have been the subject of numerous investigations. Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale, Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), and the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) is used to evaluate post-treatment changes.

In many [studies](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fped.2022.897398/full), it was observed that the post-treatment evaluation scores changed significantly in a positive way.

According to the findings of the [meta-analysis](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fped.2022.897398/full), which looked at five studies with 315 individuals, the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) score of the stem cell group was significantly lower than the control group. (lower score = less autism symptoms)

In particular, improvements were observed in the following behaviors;
* Increased social communication skills
* Decreased repetitive behaviors
* Less hyperactivity and aggression
* Reduced anxiety and fear

> It is important to remember that improvements can vary significantly from patient to patient due to a variety of factors, including the patient's age, severity, physical condition, lifestyle, and more. Therefore, improvement cannot be guaranteed.
