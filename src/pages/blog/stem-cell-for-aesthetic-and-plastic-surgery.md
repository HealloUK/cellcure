We can divide stem cell applications into two main groups in terms of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery. The first of these is aesthetic applications. Stem cell applications have great promise, especially for the skin's rejuvenation process. When fat injection enriched with stem cells, it increases the effect of the treatment of removing wrinkles and aged appearance on the hand skin and face. The use of own tissues prevents the patient from allergies and many similar side effects. The effect of applications made with fillers and similar materials is temporary. However, Stem cell treatment has the potential to give much more permanent and effective results.



## **Facial and Body Fillers**

In fillings made with non-natural products such as implants, up to 70% of the filling is reabsorbed by the body. And the body may show allergic reactions to these artificial substances. However, with the fillings made with the use of regenerative cells taken from the person’s own body, this problem is minimized and a more natural and permanent youthful appearance is achieved, away from artificiality. Therefore, one-time injections with regenerative cells are effective instead of repeated operations.

## **Hope for Unhealed Wounds**

The second field of application in Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery is a group of diseases that there are skin and subcutaneous tissue changes due to non-healing wounds, blood supply disorder or radiotherapy applications, and medicine has a difficulty in. Pressure sores (bed sores) are skin and/or subcutaneous tissue damage, usually over bony prominences, caused by pressure alone or by friction and pressure. Bed-bound, wheelchair-bound patients have a pressure on soft tissues due to the pressure created by body weight. The blood circulation in these tissues, which are stuck between the bone and the bed, is disturbed and eventually the tissues are damaged. [Stem cells promote vascularization](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4976995/) around wounds, which boosts circulation there. They also support and stimulate the immune system, which speeds up tissue regeneration.

## **Burn Treatments**

Third-grade burns are among the most difficult cases that cosmetic surgery has to deal with. During the wound healing process, cytokines, chemokines and growth factors work in harmony. Focusing on only one phase or one signal molecule in this process does not provide effective regeneration and healing. After a burn damage, current skin substitution treatments cannot restore fully functional skin. They don't specifically target chemokine or cytokine release to affect healing.

[The ability of stem cells](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8418374/#:~:text=The%20therapeutic%20potential%20of%20stem%20cells%20for%20burn%20wound%20healing%20arises%20from%20their%20ability%20to%20modulate%20the%20release%20of%20the%20chemokines%2C%20cytokines%2C%20and%20growth%20factors%20necessary%20for%20wound%20healing.) to modulate the release of the chemokines, cytokines, and growth factors critical for wound healing gives them therapeutic potential for treating burn wound repair. Stem cell therapy promotes the regeneration of damaged tissue and improves the patient's appearance by utilizing its features such as regulating inflammation, differentiation into cells belonging to the skin and subcutaneous tissues, increasing vascularity in damaged areas, synthesizing proteins such as collagen that provide skin strength and flexibility.

## **Tissue Engineering**

The skin is an organ with several layers(epidermis, dermis, hypodermis) that serves a variety of crucial functions. If there is a problem with the functions of this complex organ, it can lead to serious consequences.

The majority of the cells(%90) in the epidermis, the skin's top layer, are keratinocytes. These cells have an important function in the growth of new skin tissue and skin regeneration with the chemicals they secrete. 

The cells must remain true to the original structure and shape of the skin while regenerating the lost skin. So how will cells know the skin structure they are supposed to form? Just as constructions have scaffolds, skin-forming construction has an Extracellular matrix. It’s like a blueprint of tissue structure. Extracellular matrix provides structural integrity by guiding cells on how to create a skin structure.

Keratinocytes do not function as expected and are unable to form the desired skin tissue under conditions when a major portion of the skin has been damaged and there is no functional skin structure to guide them, such as deep burn wounds.

To reproduce skin normally, keratinocytes require an extracellular matrix structure composed of collagen generated by cells known as fibroblasts.
 
One of the most important issues of tissue engineering is the formation of a new dermis by artificially creating the extracellular matrix and transferring it to the patient.
Collagen scaffold, a 3-dimensional porous collagen network, when placed on the damaged area, allows fresh tissue to accumulate homogeneously throughout the damaged tissue. 

Tissue engineering not only focus to repairing damaged skin tissue. 
The aim of tissue engineering is to produce damaged tissues and organs outside the body and transplant them to the patient, to prevent death due to tissue and organ loss and to increase the patient's quality of life.

## **Breast Reconstruction**

Breast cancer treatment usually results in the removal of part or all of the breast. Dealing with another surgery for breast aesthetics after a difficult treatment process can be physically and emotionally exhausting.

For many years, the only options for breast reconstruction were implants or highly invasive flap procedures using tissue from the hips,belly, etc. A scar at the donor site and extended healing are required for flap surgery. In addition, implants can cause an allergic reaction.

Breast reconstruction is now performed using stem cells. Breast fat tissue regrowth naturally as a result of stem cell therapy. In the treatment, the patient's own body fat and stem cells obtained from the adipose tissue are used. Fat harvested with liposuction from the abdomen, usually 200-500 cc, is processed in a laboratory environment to isolate the stem cells in the adipose tissue. After the newly grafted fat is enriched with a stem cell, it is injected into the treated breasts. 

In most cases, postoperative recovery is limited to bruising and swelling in the breast and the liposuction harvest area. As a result, nature-looking breasts are achieved without fear of damage from implants.
