The introduction of the patient's own stem cells to the problem area by growing them in lab conditions is known as autologous stem cell therapy. More or less stem cells are present in all organs. The richest sources of stem cells are umbilical cord blood, adipose tissue, bone marrow and skin.

[Recent studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8781097/) show that, by increasing the person's own stem cells, skin issues like acne scars, wounds, and wrinkles can be largely removed without the need for surgery.

Stem cells required for skin rejuvenation treatment can be taken from adipose tissue or skin.

## **What makes us look young?**

There are two important factors besides the general health of our skin to look healthy, young and tight. These are collagen and elastin proteins.

The top layer of our skin is the epidermis, followed by the middle and bottom layers, the dermis and hypodermis. The [dermis is a connective tissue layer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK535346/#:~:text=The%20dermis%20is%20a%20connective,%2C%20hair%20follicles%2C%20and%20glands.) sandwiched between the epidermis and subcutaneous tissue. The dermis is mostly made of collagen and elastic fibers. Collagen is the main substance of dermis and all connective tissues. It contributes to skin's flexibility, hydration, and strength. Within the dermis, elastic fibers also perform a significant structural role. Elastic fibers are composed of elastin and fibrillin microfibrils. Elastin provides the skin elasticity and stretch. It is around 1,000 times more flexible than collagen.

The skin begins to wrinkle and sag from the dermis layer. Because with age, the basic components of this layer, collagen and elastin, begin to decrease. This causes our skin to look older.

## **Why do collagen and elastin decrease?**

Skin aging is characterized by a gradual loss of elastin and collagen, which results in wrinkles and skin drooping. These substances are secreted by fibroblasts. Fibroblasts are the most common cell in connective tissue.

After the age of 25-30, the fibroblast level gradually decreases. This causes a decrease in collagen and elastin production. As the fibroblasts decrease, lines, sagging and signs of aging begin to appear over time.

## **What are the application areas of fibroblast treatment?**

* Skin regeneration and rejuvenation (such as face, hand, decollete) 
* Treatment of wrinkles 
* Treatment of acne scars 
* Treatment of hair loss

## **How are Stem Cells derived from the skin?**

Approximately 3mm punch biopsy is taken from the sun-free area of the patient’s skin, such as behind the ear, and younger fibroblasts of the patient are produced by culturing in a special culture medium under GMP conditions in our laboratories. This is a process of approximately 4-6 weeks. When the appropriate number and maturity of cells is reached for treatment, the patient is treated. Using very fine-tipped needles, specialist physicians inject fibroblast cells into the application area.The application is applied in 2 seasons at intervals of 15-30 days. The whole process is pretty quick and easy. The process can be repeated according to the treatment plan.

## **How does it work?**

Fibroblasts are cells that are typically found in the skin's connective tissue and are responsible for the creation of collagen, which gives skin its youth and flexibility. Cells injected into the skin with this treatment increase the thickness and density of the skin’s collagen by producing collagen in the area where they are applied. The formation of new skin cells, the promotion of vascularization, the increase of blood circulation, the stimulation of immune system cells can exert their effects on the deformed area with their properties. Thus, the depth of lines and wrinkles decreases, acne scars in the form of pits are lightened, the skin can gain a more tense, bright and smooth appearance. Also, the thinning of the skin is prevented and the aging process can be slowed down. 

Within 24 hours of completing the application, the applicant can resume their regular activities. The effect of the application can last for many years. This period may vary depending on factors such as smoking, skin structure, nutritional habits, age, genetic structure and ultraviolet rays.

## **What are the side effects?**

There is no known significant side effects. Rarely, the injection sites may develop some redness, edema, and bruising right away after application. However, it disappears on its own within 24 hours at the latest. Since the cells are produced from the person’s own tissue, there is no possibility of an allergic reaction.
