We perform Stem Cell treatments in a fully equipped hospital in Istanbul, Turkey approved by the Ministry of Health at international standards, in compliance with current good manufacturing practices (cGMP).

## **Aim: Accessible Safe Treatment**

The findings of research in the field of regenerative medicine allow us to learn more about how stem cell therapy works for diseases that are challenging to cure and to create new treatment plans in this area. However, many people who want to take advantage of these innovative treatments may face the barriers of location and high cost.

Edge Medica's mission is to expand access to cutting-edge stem cell therapies by offering them competitive prices without compromising quality, safety, or comfort. 

We aim to ensure that the quality of our services is verifiable so that patients traveling to Turkey from other countries for treatment do not have to worry about the care they will receive there.

We can use all administration methods such as intravenous, intramuscular, intrathecal, local injections, etc. to maximize the probability of success according to the type of disease.

## **Why did we choose Turkey for the Stem Cell Treatment center?**

It is known that Turkey has a very important place in health tourism in terms of health technologies, doctor quality and price advantage. Half a million visitors every year for treatment confirm this.
