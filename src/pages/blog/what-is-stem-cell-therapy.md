Stem Cell research has been going on all over the world for more than 30 years. 
We have learned a lot from the results of completed and ongoing scientific studies on the efficacy and safety of stem cell treatment of diseases such as autism, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, conditions after a heart attack or stroke, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary, Alzheimer's disease, Crohn's disease, Spinal Cord Injury, rheumatic diseases, Cerebral Palsy, Traumatic Brain Injury ,and many others.
The evidence on this subject is growing day by day. Stem Cells are also used in aesthetic applications.

Stem Cell can be obtained from the patient's own tissue(autologous) or from a donor(allogeneic).

At our clinic in Turkey, We isolate and produce cell products such as Adipose tissue-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cell, Umbilical cord-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cell, Synovium-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cell, Fibroblast, Cartilage cell (Chondrocyte) in world-class laboratories, in a way approved and licensed by the Ministry of Health of Turkey, under GMP conditions.

Nowadays, bone marrow, the umbilical cord, joint fluid or membrane, and umbilical adipose tissue are the most widely used sources in treatment-purposed stem cell applications.

Cell products can be transferred intravenously, intramuscularly, by inhalation, into the spinal canal or directly to the damaged area, depending on the condition of the disease.

The situation of patients can be very different from each other, so it is necessary to design a personalized treatment strategy. The effect of Stem Cell therapy increases when applied together with many different therapeutic methods.



## **What is Stem Cell and how does it work?**

Stem Cells found in all of our tissues and organs allow our hair to grow, to renew our skin after a cut, to renew our tissues in trauma-related injuries, to prevent our defense cells from attacking our own tissues and cells by regulating our immune system and repairing the damage in our nervous system and many more.

Studies have shown that Stem Cell's only ability is not to make cells of the tissues and organs it is in, but it can also make cells of different tissues and organs when they are taken into laboratory environments.

In addition to the ability of stem cells to transform into cells of other tissues and organs, we learned that they positively contribute to many pathological processes by suppressing alarmed immune responses, having a high anti-inflammatory effect, stopping or slowing down unwanted pathological processes such as new vessel formation potential, fibrosis, and anti-bacterial properties.

Stem cells are cells that have the ability to differentiate into several cell types and renew themselves. From a single stem cell, millions of cells can arise.

Some features of stem cells are very important in the use of these cells for treatment-purposes:
* When injected into a vein following tissue damage, they can settle in the inflammatory area.
* They have the capacity to release a significant number of bioactive molecules that promote the repair of injured cells and reduce inflammation.
* They do not cause allergic reactions in the body.
* They can stimulate the growth of new blood vessels and neurons, and they have immunomodulatory effects.
* They can differentiate into different cell types.

Transplanted Stem Cells trigger the local stem cells in the body to help to restore the damaged tissue.

When stem cells are injected into a patient's body during therapy, They move through the bloodstream until they are driven to molecules secreted by tissues that are inflamed or damaged. After the stem cells reach the damaged area, they settle in this area and begin to produce various growth factors, [chemokines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemokine)(Calls the cells to the damaged area), and [adhesion molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion_molecule)(help cells stick to each other and to their surroundings).

These chemicals, which are secreted into the intercellular space, activate distant cells to repair the damaged tissue, as if communicating with radio. This form of communication between cells is called Paracrine Signaling.

The anti-inflammatory effect of Stem Cells is due to the cytokine substance it produces. In several disorders, cytokines help in blocking the signals of inflammation.

## **Where are Stem Cells obtained?**

Although stem cells can theoretically be obtained from a variety of tissues and organs, at the moment bone marrow, the umbilical cord, joint fluid or membrane, and umbilical adipose tissue are the sources that are most frequently used in stem cell applications for medical treatments.

* A biopsy sample is taken from the tissue suitable for the patient's condition.
* The relevant cells are separated from this biopsy sample.
* Isolated cells multiplied by being fed continuously and undergoing detailed controls under appropriate conditions.
* It could take up to 4-6 weeks for the stem cells to be extracted from a biopsy sample, cultivated, multiplied in the needed number, and prepared for transplantation.
