There are many positive and negative comments regarding the safety of Stem Cell Therapy. This situation confuses people who are interested in Stem Cell. In this article, we will focus only on authoritative scientific evidence, leaving aside all personal speculation.

First, let's have a quick idea of Stem Cell and Stem Cell Therapy.

## **What are stem cells?**

Stem cells are cells that have the ability to differentiate into other cell types. They can give rise to any of the specialized cell types in the body. Because of this capability, stem cells can be used to regenerate and repair tissues that have been damaged.

There are two main types of stem cells: embryonic stem cells, which come from early stage embryos, and [adult stem cells](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3340558/), which are found in various tissues throughout the body.

Multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells(MMSCs), also known as mesenchymal stem cells(MSC), are the most popular type of cells used in cell therapy.

## **How stem cell therapy works?**

Therapeutic use of stem cells involves taking them from the patient's body (autologous) or from donors (allogeneic), expanding them in culture, then delivering them back to the patient where they will differentiate into new tissue and help repair damaged tissue.

Stem cells are able to secrete a variety of growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules that can influence the behavior of surrounding cells. This process, known as paracrine regulation, is thought to play an important role in tissue regeneration and repair.

Thanks to all these features, Stem Cell is used in the treatment of many diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases, musculoskeletal system injuries, lung and heart diseases, digestive system diseases etc.

## **Is Cell Therapy safe?**

It is the right choice to rely only on the evidence presented by scientific studies, instead of listening to the different voices of every head about the reliability of Stem Cell therapy.

The evidence supporting the safety of Stem Cell therapy is increasing day by day. These studies are not just for scientists. Examining the results of studies helps you to have an idea even if you don't have any scientific knowledge.

Since it is not possible to examine the results of all studies in this article, I will talk about a meta-analysis - Examining the results of many studies as if they were one study - on the [Safety of Mesenchymal Stem Cell(MSC) therapy over last 15 years](https://stemcellres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13287-021-02609-x).

Among the studies until March 1, 2021, those that do not meet certain conditions are eliminated and 62 clinic trials are selected.

This study has 3546 participants with various diseases (about 20 kinds of diseases) being treated by intravenous or local implantation with MSC.

The summary of the study result is as follows;
> “We summarized all adverse events potentially related to the application of MSCs, and no serious safety events other than transient fever, administration site adverse events, sleeplessness and constipation were discovered.”
