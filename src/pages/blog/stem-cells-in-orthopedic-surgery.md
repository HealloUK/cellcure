Our understanding of cells and stem cells has increased significantly in recent years, parallel to the exponential growth in stem cell researches. Our perspectives on treatment options have changed as a result of new informations. Of course, these changes have also affected the field of orthopedics. The use of stem cells for various orthopedic disorders has been suggested by a number of experimental studies, and promising early clinical results have been reported. These cells can be obtained from many different parts of the body. It is reproduced under laboratory conditions and administered to the patient. The use of stem cells has the potential to completely change orthopedic practice, from the healing of bone defects caused by trauma, tumor, or infection to cartilage defects, nerve, tendon, and ligament healing.


## **What is Stem Cell?**

Stem cells are unspecialized cells that have the ability to proliferate, renew themselves, transform into differentiated cells and renew tissues. There are stem cell types such as Embryonic Stem Cells (ESCs), Adult Stem Cells (ASCs), Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs). Adult stem cells originated from the mesoderm, known as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have a high potential to differentiate into adipocytes, chondrocytes, myoblasts, and osteoblasts. Stem cells can be obtained from a variety of tissues, such as bone marrow, adipose tissue, periosteum, human amniotic fluid, placenta, umbilical cord, etc. Stem cells may be administered locally or intravenously.

## **How Do Stem Cells Work?**

Stem Cell's only feature is not its ability to transform into different cells such as bone, muscle, cartilage, ligament or tendon cells. They move to the damaged region when they notice signals coming from there. In addition, they stimulate the cells around them to regenerate and repair with the messenger chemicals they secrete, such as cytokines and growth factors. This effect of stem cells on surrounding cells is called the paracrine effect. [This feature](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5393127/#:~:text=These%20play%20an%20important%20role%20in%20angiogenesis%2C%20repair%2C%20cell%20survival%20and%20proliferation.) plays an important role in repair, angiogenesis(formation of new blood vessels), cell survival and proliferation(rapid reproduction of a cell). Some proteins that stem cells release regulate the inflammatory response.

## **Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Orthopedic Surgery**

Stem cell's ability to transform into many cells including bone, cartilage, muscle, tendon, and ligament cells, its regeneration triggering effect on surrounding cells, and the results of many [clinical trials](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5393127/#:~:text=Recent%20(within%205%20years)%20clinical%20studies) and [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5393127/) have encouraged us to use stem cells for orthopedic conditions.

## **Trauma and Bone defects**

Bone defect is a lack of bone tissue in an area of the body where bone should normally be present. Bone defects may be caused by trauma, tumor or infection. Surgical reconstruction of bone defects is a challenging aspect. A critically sized bone defect is defined as a condition that will not repair spontaneously during the patient's lifetime. Large defects (>10 mm) in humans are usually treated with bone graft transplantation. However, this treatment has limiting factors such as availability of graft material, donor site morbidity, and insufficient integration.

Most in vitro(in a test tube) and many in vivo(in the body) [studies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006291X0700006X) have suggested that the MSCs have the potential to increase osteoinduction and osteogenesis(formation of bone). In nonunion fractures, stem cells can be [injected directly](https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/469704) to the bone defect area.
However, in cases where a large amount of bone tissue is lost, direct injection has been [found to be ineffective](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4215372/#:~:text=Direct%20injection%20of%20MSCs%20has%20been%20found%20to%20be%20ineffective%20for%20very%20large%20bone%20defects%20or%20non%2Dunion%20of%20bone.) in bone healing. However, such cases can be treated effectively by putting MSCs to a biomaterial scaffold. Numerous investigations have verified the efficiency of bioscaffolds.

## **Intervertebral disc degeneration(IDD)**

The intervertebral discs are gelly fibrocartilage tissue that acts as a shock-absorbing system in the spine. Back and neck pain are common symptoms of disk degeneration, and they can lead to a variety of disabilities. Current treatments such as physiotherapy, pharmacotherapy, and surgery are pain-relieving approaches that in most cases do not restore lost function.

It has been [demonstrated](https://stemcellres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13287-022-02745-y) in vitro, in vivo, and in clinical trials that stem cells from various sources can reduce pain and other symptoms, reverse the process of degeneration, delay aging, maintain the shape of the spine, and retain mechanical function. However, more investigation is required to clarify how stem cells perform these functions and what effects they have on the treatment of IDD.

## **Osteoporosis**

Osteoporosis is a metabolic bone disease that causes bone loss and microstructural degeneration. Osteoporosis is mostly influenced by homing abnormalities, decreased osteogenic differentiation capacity, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) senescence, an unbalanced microenvironment, and disordered immunoregulation. 

The MSC transplantation aims to balance bone creation and resorption by promoting osteoblast development, preventing osteoclast activation, and increasing bone formation. MSC transplantation has the potential to stimulate osteoblast development while also inhibiting osteoclast activation and increasing bone formation. [Preclinical researches](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cpr.12956#:~:text=PRECLINICAL%20INVESTIGATIONS) on MSC transplantation for the treatment of osteoporosis shows that it can increase osteogenic differentiation, increase bone mineral density, and slow the progression of osteoporosis.

## **Wound Healing**

Even though chronic wounds are widespread, treatment for these disabling conditions is limited and largely ineffective. Phases of wound healing are a highly coordinated process that starts as a result of damage and restores the integrity of the affected tissues. The available drugs for wound healing require a longer recovery period. There are several complications as a result of the delayed wound healing process.

The ability of stem cells to release pro-regenerative cytokines is primarily responsible for their potential for wound repair. [Stem cells](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcell.2021.821652/full) can help wound healing by regulating inflammation, inducing angiogenesis, stimulating the production of fibroblasts and keratinocytes, and creating an extracellular matrix that works as a scaffold.

## **Osteoarthritis(OA)**

Osteoarthritis(OA) is a common chronic joint condition characterized by articular cartilage degeneration. Most OA treatments, such as physical therapy, medication, and surgery, do not offer a permanent solution. 

MSCs have the ability for stimulating chondrocyte regeneration and cartilage differentiation. There are [studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22314040/) in animal models where stem cell therapy resulted in cartilage regeneration. In addition, after autologous mesenchymal [stem cell implantation in a person](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18523506) with degenerative joint disease, significant cartilage growth, pain reduction and increased joint mobility were observed.

## **Rheumatoid Arthritis(RA)**

RA is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system mistakenly attacks the joints, causing joint inflammation and pain. RA-related inflammation has the potential to harm other parts of the body as well. Long-term use of steroid drugs, antirheumatic drugs used in traditional treatment may cause side effects or the patient may become resistant to drugs.

The immunomodulatory effect of stem cells on the immune system makes them a suitable candidate for the Rheumatoid arthritis(RA) treatment. MSCs have the [ability](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8584240/#:~:text=Alternatively%2C%20MSCs%20have%20the%20ability) to inhibit the proliferation of effector memory T cells, which can secrete inflammation-promoting cytokines found at high frequencies in the peripheral blood and synovial fluid of RA patients. Early clinical trials [reported](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8584240/#B11-ijms-22-11592:~:text=early%20clinical%20studies) over the past ten years have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of  MSC transplantation for the treatment of RA patients. Despite the promising results of clinical studies, some of the studies have limitations such as not including placebo control, collecting patients from a single center, and low number of patients. More studies are needed to confirm the available clinical data.

## **Avascular Necrosis**

In osteonecrosis, also known as avascular necrosis, osteoblasts become unable to repair themselves, deterioration leads to a decrease in blood flow, and eventually femoral head collapse. In young patients, this causes severe hip pain and dysfunction. If the femoral head collapses, it requires a total hip arthroplasty(hip replacement). Total hip replacement results may not be perfect due to issues like prosthetic loosening, periprosthetic infection, need for revision, etc.

> “This novel stem cell therapy has demonstrated improved pain and function, and the stem cells decrease the risk of the femoral head from collapsing. That ultimately translates into fewer young patients requiring hip replacements along with subsequent surgeries in their later years” [said](https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/stem-cells-used-to-treat-avascular-necrosis-of-the-femoral-head/#:~:text=says.%20%E2%80%9CThis%20novel-,stem%20cell%20therapy,-has%20demonstrated%20improved) Assistant Professor of Orthopedics and Rehabilitation Daniel Wiznia from Yale University

[In another study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23852661/#:~:text=of%202%20years.-,Results,-%3A%20On%202), 60 hips in the early stages of AVN were selected to be treated with either core decompression and stem cell injections. Two year follow up,  revealed that the stem cell group had a better functional result and improved radiographic recovery.

## **Other Stem Cell Treatments in Orthopedics**

Some of the commonly used treatments are as follows;
* Tendon injuries and tendinitis/tendinosis problems
* Applications in spine problems
* Applications in joint degenerations
* Tennis elbow
* Soft tissue problems in sports injuries
* Avascular necrosis

## **Summary**

Bone and cartilage issues can complicate life with the pain and disability they may cause. Almost all current treatments aim to reduce symptoms. Stem cell therapy is introduced as a promising treatment with potential therapeutic implications for osteochondral diseases. 

[Clinical studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5393127/#:~:text=within%205%20years) in the last 5 years, utilizing stem cell use in orthopedic surgery results are encouraging about the efficacy and safety of the treatment.

Clinical trials using stem cells in orthopedic surgery during the last five years have produced encouraging results about the effectiveness and safety of the therapy.
