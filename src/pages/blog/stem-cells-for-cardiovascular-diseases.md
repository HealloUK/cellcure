Cardiovascular diseases are the number one cause of death worldwide. A myocardial infarction, commonly known as a heart attack, occurs when the blood supply to the heart is blocked. This blockage reduces the blood flow to the heart and therefore not enough oxygen gets supplied. If one of the coronary arteries is blocked, heart cells that it feeds start to die within 20-30 minutes. If a vessel is not reopened quickly, most of the heart cells die within a few hours. The heart has a limited ability to regenerate, and the loss of function that results from damaged heart muscle usually cannot be fully restored. In this case, patients have to continue their lives with reduced cardiac function that cannot meet the body's blood flow needs. This progressive condition often results in heart failure. Once heart cells die, the body cannot repair them. Many clinical studies all over the world have shown that stem cells can reverse this process.


## **How Stem Cells help to treat cardiovascular diseases?**

Some of the [therapeutic properties](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41419-020-2542-9#:~:text=vitro16.-,Properties,-of%20MSCs) of stem cell are as follows;

MSCs have the ability to differentiate into cardiovascular cells.

MSCs exert their therapeutic effects in cardiovascular diseases by secreting chemicals that influence other cells. These chemicals stimulate surrounding cells to repair and regenerate. This effect on surrounding cells is called the paracrine effect.

MSCs can help treat cardiovascular diseases by modulating the immune system(immunomodulatory), reducing fibrosis(antifibrotic effect) and promoting blood vessel growth(neovascularization).

Following an infarction, heart muscle damage often results in cardiac failure. Stem cell treatment is used to repair damage to the heart muscle. Stem cells harvested from the patient's adipose tissue are extracted, cultured and injected into the coronary vein in patients who have had an infarction. Transplanted MSCs can [locate](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41419-020-2542-9#:~:text=transplanted%20MSCs%20can-,migrate,-to%20infarcted%20myocardial) the damaged area by following chemical signals. Stem cells settled in this region can reduce the inflammatory response, reduce fibrosis, promote the formation of new blood vessels, and differentiate into cardiomyocyte-like cells. These and many more features can contribute to the repair of the damaged heart muscle. 

Studies have shown that approximately 6 months after treatment, there is a significant improvement in the damaged area of the heart and the heart's blood pumping power increases.

## **Methods of Stem Cell Delivery**

For optimal cell therapy, high concentrations of stem cells must deliver to the damaged area of the heart with minimal loss. Numerous administration methods have been used to transport cells, including intravenous, intracoronary, intramyocardial, and intrapericardial. The doctor decides the method of administration depending on the patient's current disease.

Intracoronary delivery: This method has been the most commonly used method of stem cell delivery, particularly for stem cell treatment after a heart attack. Catheter-based intramyocardial injection, which is less invasive than surgery, is a good alternative for individuals who are at high risk for surgery. A catheter is inserted through the inguinal vein and advanced inside the vein until it reaches the damaged area, similar to the angiography procedure. Stem cells can be [injected](https://stemcellres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/scrt29#:~:text=Cells%20can%20be-,injected,-while%20either%20maintaining) while maintaining coronary flow, or blood flow can be stopped temporarily by inflating the balloon on the catheter.

Intramyocardial delivery: Cells can be [injected directly](https://stemcellres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/scrt29#:~:text=Cells%20can%20be-,injected%20directly,-into%20the%20myocardium) into heart muscle during open heart surgery. When the coronary artery restricts transvascular cell delivery, such direct injection methods may be performed. It is often used as an adjunct to coronary artery bypass grafting.

## **Can your body reject stem cells?**

Stem cells to be transplanted into heart tissue are obtained from the patient's adipose tissue. They are the patient's own cells. As a result, the body has no reason to reject these cells.
