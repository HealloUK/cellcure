One of the most important inventions in cell biology over the past 30 years has been the discovery of exosomes. Exosomes are extracellular vesicles secreted by cells. They are smallest type of extracellular vesicle with dimensions of 30-150 nm in diameter. They are released by almost all cells in the body. Initially, exosomes were thought to be cellular waste products, but later it became clear that they had much more important functions.

Exosomes are vesicular information packages. They are mediators in cell-to-cell communication. They contain many biomolecules such as proteins, lipids, DNA, mRNAs (messenger RNA), miRNAs (microRNA), lncRNAs (long non-coding RNA). They also carry biomolecules specific to the cells from which they came from. Exosomes perform intercellular transfer of components. These biomolecules are used to regulate the recipient cell's gene expression. In this way, Exosomes are involved in a variety of biological processes, including the regulation of the immune system, cell differentiation, intercellular communication, and cell migration.

They last long in the blood circulation and can change functions and behavior of other cells.

## **Some Important Functions of Exosomes**

Exosomes can target a specific organ or tissue such as brain, lung, kidney, liver etc.

Exosomes can cross the blood-brain barrier, making them very useful in the treatment of neurological diseases. In addition, due to this feature, it can be administered intravenously, which is more painless, instead of giving directly to spinal fluid.

Its effects in [reducing brain neuroinflammation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7037429/#:~:text=Therapeutic%20exosomes%20could%20be%20intravenously,ameliorating%20brain%20neuroinflammation%20in%20situ.) may be effective in the treatment of Autism.

There are [many studies](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2018.00434/full) showing that it has a significant effect on the repair of damaged myelin sheath(Multiple sclerosis - MS).

Remove waste like the [amyloid-beta(Aβ) accumulation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8509246/) in Alzheimer's disease.

These and many other features make exosomes an important tool in the field of Regenerative Medicine.
